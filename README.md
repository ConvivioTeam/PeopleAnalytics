# Convivio People Analytics app prototype

We want to grow the business in a healthy way. To do this, we are beginning to track some important pieces of information about who we are and what we're like. Knowing this information will inform our actions and decisions as we grow.

There's more about what we're doing in our blog, '[How weâ€™re using people analytics to grow a healthy agency](https://blog.weareconvivio.com/how-were-using-people-analytics-to-grow-a-healthy-agency-78a993049aba)'.

## This Prototype

This is a prototype of an app we might use to keep track of things.
